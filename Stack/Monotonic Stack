About Monotonic Stack:
Monotonic Stack is a kind of data structure that is used to store the elements in  a particular order , either increasing or decreasing. It is a stack 
that ensures that whenever an element is going to be inserted it doesn't break the rule or the order. if the element is breaking the order then the 
elements are removed uptill the rule is no longer broken and then the new element is added.
Useful for solving problems like Next Greater Elemenet, Next Smaller Element, etc.
